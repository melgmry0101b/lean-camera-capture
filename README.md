What is Lean Camera Capture?
----------------------------

As the name suggests, this is a "lean" library to help capturing still images from a camera feed on Windows for .NET applications either WinForms or WPF. The library is built on Media Foundation APIs, we can say it is a bridge between the managed world and the outer universe!
